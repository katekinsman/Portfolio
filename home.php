                <p>Hello.</p>
                <p>I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Informatics from the University of Washington in June 2014. </p>
                <p>What exactly is Informatics? (Come on, we were all wondering.) Informatics is a unique blend of computer
                    science, design, and business. We focus on using these disciplines to make the information you're
                    consuming, and the way you're consuming it, make sense. Our goal is that no matter who you are, what kind
                    of information you consume, or how you consume it, the information systems we build help you
                    do so effortlessly.</p>
                <p>I'm excited by the possibilities that abound in this area. With the emergence of networked technology,
                    a glut of information was made available to people. In the rush to get it all out there, we cobbled
                    together information in whatever ways we could. We're at an interesting place in time where not only can
                    we slow down and reassemble existing information in ways that add value, but we also have the opportunity
                    to innovatively assemble and make available new information to change how people live their lives.</p>
                <p>With that said, I have extensive leadership experience through managing employees, leading student
                    organizations, and guiding/teaching in the outdoor industry. My degree has also given me hands-on
                    experience with networking and communicating, learning new technologies, and building simple and
                    effective information systems. I have by no means learned all there is to know,
                    and I'm excited to continue learning wherever life takes me. I hope that you will take the time to view my
                    online portfolio and resume to get a better idea of some of the projects I have worked on so far.</p>
                <p>Besides computing, I have a passion for mountaineering, horseback riding, downhill skiing, and
                    climbing. I also enjoy baking, chocolate production, literature, hand-lettering,
                    and drawing. My ideal career would combine my passion for the outdoors and the environment with my
                    love of computing.</p>
