            <p>Hello.</p>
            <p>I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Informatics from the University of Washington in June 2014. </p>
            <p>What exactly is Informatics? (Come on, we were all wondering.) Informatics is a unique blend of computer
                science, design, and business. We focus on using these disciplines to make the information you're
                consuming (and the way you're consuming it) make sense. Our goal is that no matter who you are, what kind
                of information you consume, or how you consume it, the information systems we build help you
                do so effortlessly.</p>
            <p>Since graduating, my work at The Walt Disney Company has given me hands-on experience with many different
                technologies, processes, and team cultures. I thrive in an environment where I'm pushed into the deep end,
                forced to master new technologies and business spaces quickly. I highly prize the mentorship that I have
                received, and I am committed to perpetuating that wherever I go, whether in official or unofficial capacties.</p>
            <p>I have by no means learned all there is to know,
                and I'm excited to continue learning wherever life takes me. I hope that you will take the time to view my
                online portfolio and resume to get a better idea of some of the projects I have worked on so far.</p>
            <p>Besides computing, I have a passion for mountaineering, horseback riding, downhill skiing, and
                surfing. I also enjoy knitting, sewing, baking, chocolate production, literature, and hand-lettering.
                My ideal career would combine my passion for the outdoors and the environment with my love of computing.</p>
