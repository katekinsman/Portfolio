    <article id="intro">
        <p>Hello.</p>
        <p>I am currently working towards a Bachelor of Science in Informatics with a concentration in Human Computer
            Interaction from the University of Washington. My expected graduation date is June 2014. </p>
        <p>What exactly is Informatics? (Come on, we were all wondering.) Informatics is a unique blend of computer
            science, design, and business. We focus on using these disciplines to make the information you're
            consuming, and the way you're consuming it, make sense. Our goal is that no matter who you are, what kind
            of information you consume, or how you consume it, the information systems we build help you
            do so effortlessly.</p>
        <p>I'm excited by the possibilities that abound in this area. With the emergence of networked technology,
            a glut of information was made available to people. In the excitement of the moment,
            masses of information were jumbled together in whatever way possible. We're at an interesting place in
            time where not only can we slow down and reassemble that heap in ways that add value,
            but we also have the opportunity to innovatively assemble and make available new information to change how
            people live their lives.</p>
        <p>With that said, I have extensive leadership experience through managing employees and leading student
            organizations. My degree has also given me hands-on experience with networking and communicating, learning new technologies,
            and building simple and effective information systems. I have by no means learned all there is to know,
            and I'm excited to continue learning wherever life takes me. I hope that you will take the time to view my
            online portfolio and resume to get a better idea of some of the projects I have worked on so far.</p>
        <p>Besides computing, I have a passion for horseback riding, downhill skiing, backpacking, and climbing. I also
            enjoy baking, chocolate production, literature, hand-lettering, and drawing.</p>
