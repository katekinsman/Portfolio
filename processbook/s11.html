    <h2>Draft 4</h2>
    <p>
        Draft 4 was the final draft of our prototypes. Because of Lucidchart's inflexibility we went back
        to using Balsamiq. The more sketch-like nature of the Balsamic wireframes also better conveyed our
        ideas and encouraged less pixel-perfect behaviours. Because David was the only one with access to this program,
        he made the wireframes once again. Below are the final wireframes.
