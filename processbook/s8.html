    <h2>Decisions</h2>
    <p>After discussing it at length, our team decided that our design had an essential functionality that Space Scout
        did not: we allowed the user to search for personalized results using preferences. Thus we decided to move
        forward with our design, differentiating our app from theirs with that functionality.</p>
    <p>We brainstormed ideas for new wireframes that incorporated the information and suggestions we received from the
        usability tests and emphasized details that differentiated our app from Space Scout,
        and David implemented our ideas in Balsamiq.</p>
