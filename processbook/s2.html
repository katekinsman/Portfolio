    <h2>Ideation</h2>
    <p>
        We were given the task of creating a design that solved a problem related to the theme of
        "Surviving College". Each member of our team individually brainstormed three possible problems. We then
        reconvened and discussed our ideas. There was a bit of tiptoeing around everyone's ideas because, as a new
        team, we didn't want to hurt one another's feelings. Despite this, we pretty much right away settled on trying
        to solve a problem Vijai came up with: finding open outlets and school computers quickly and easily in order
        to enable people to find study spots quicker.

    <h3>Communication</h3>
    <p>
        During this time, it also became apparent that we would need to establish a means of communication with each
        other outside of class. We decided to use the groups feature on facebook because of its ubiquity and ease
        of use. It allowed us to communicate quickly, and to share files.

        Later on we utilized a shared Google Drive to share files and to create plans for executing various tasks. We
        added this communication avenue mainly because it allowed the whole team to simultaneously edit and view
        files in real time without fear of overwriting others' changes.
