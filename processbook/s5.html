    <h2>Draft 1</h2>
    <p>Armed with these two ideas, we set out to create very low-fidelity prototypes of both solutions. We got
        together to decide the main functionalities of each prototype before splitting off to create them.</p>
    <h3>Main Functionalities- The Monitor:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A blueprint-type map of each floor</li>
        <li>Icons representing each amenity available in each room</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Vijai drew up a prototype of this on paper.</p>
    <h3>Main Functionalities- The App:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>A 'quick search' which does not take into account preferences</li>
        <li>A 'search' which takes into account preferences</li>
        <li>Selectable preferences</li>
        <li>Building results that further filter into room results</li>
        <li>A final result that has more detailed info on the space</li>
    </ul>
    <p>David whipped up some wireframes in Balsamiq, which we then printed out. Below are the wireframes he
        created.</p>
