    <h2>Usability Tests</h2>
    <p>The next step was to gather feedback on these prototypes. I wrote out the script shown below and we split
        up into two groups to perform usability tests on fellow UW students.</p>
    <article class="script">
        <p>Thank you for taking the time to test this prototype for us. We won’t be answering any questions about how the
            design works as we test, so if you have any questions, now would be an excellent time to voice them. As you test
            out the design, it would be helpful if you would tell us what you’re thinking, like what’s confusing, what
            you’re looking for, etc. That way we know if the design is failing in any way. This is not testing your ability
            to do any particular task, it is testing the design’s ability to accurately and intuitively meet your needs.

        <h3>App:</h3>
        <p>
            For the sake of this first scenario, let’s pretend that you’re just coming from class, and you’re looking
            for a
            place to spend a few hours studying before your next class. You’ve heard about this app that helps you find a
            place to study on campus, and you’ve decided to see if it’s any good. When you bring up the app, it takes you to
            this home screen.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>What do you do next?</li>
            <li>Tell me a bit about this screen.</li>
            <li>What’s the next step?</li>
            <li>How do you think this list is organized?</li>
            <li>How do you expect this map to work?</li>
            <li>Are you satisfied with the result?</li>
            <li>What do you think the five stars are denoting?</li>
            <li>How do you feel about having a rating system? Is it helpful?</li>
            <li>Did you notice our Filter button?</li>
            <li>Are these options helpful? Are there any you’d rather see?</li>
            <li>What other features would you like to see?</li>
            <li>Is there any additional feedback you have for us?</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Monitor:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>What is this?</li>
            <li>What do you do with it?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Assume for the sake of this scenario you walk into Mary Gates looking for a study space. You see this
            monitor and decide to check it out.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What do you do next?</li>
            <li>Is there anything you can do with this page?</li>
            <li>What do you notice immediately?</li>
            <li>What is this page telling you?</li>
            <li>Is this useful information?</li>
            <li>Is there anything you can do with this page?</li>
            <li>Is there any additional feedback you have for us?</li>
        </ul>
    </article>
    <p>We gleaned several main insights from these tests:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Navigation wasn't to be consistent.</li>
        <li>Icons weren't clear enough.</li>
        <li>Filtering needed to be rethought/ made more transparent.</li>
        <li>No need for further directions in mapping.</li>
        <li>Time dimension needed to be added.</li>
        <li>A social aspect was not desirable.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We also made the crucial decision to eliminate the monitor from our design, as user feedback made it clear that
        the app fit users' needs better, and was altogether more intuitive and comprehensive.</p>
