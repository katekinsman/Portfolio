    <h2>Interviews</h2>
    <p>
        After deciding on our problem, we set about trying to better understand it. In order to collect the most data
        possible, we split up to perform interviews of fellow UW students. We first decided the general ideas we'd
        like to know more about, and then we each wrote a script for our own interviews. Upon reflection, I believe
        that collaborating to create one single script would have been more beneficial. It would have made our
        results more comparable and our interviews more comprehensive.
    </p>
    <p>The following is the script that I wrote:</p>
    <article class='script'>
        <p>Thank you for taking the time to interview with me. I just have a few questions pertaining to your schooling
            and study habits. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Do you commute or live on campus?</li>
            <li>How long are you on campus?</li>
            <li>Do you have gaps in your schedule?</li>
            <li>How long are gaps?</li>
            <li>What do you do during gaps currently?</li>
            <li>How much time is spent finding a study spot?</li>
            <li> Do you have trouble finding a spot?</li>
            <li>Do you bring a laptop to school?</li>
            <li>Where do you spend your gaps?</li>
            <li>Is your spot comfortable?</li>
            <li> What do you think of our libraries?</li>
            <li>Does your spot have all the amenities you are looking for?</li>
            <li>Is it worth it to spend the time to find an appropriate spot with right amenities?</li>
            <li> If you could find a spot with proper amenities would productivity increase?</li>
            <li>Is information about study places readily available?</li>
        </ul>
    </article>
    <p>Our team then reconvened and discovered several commonalities in our results:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>People felt that specifically knowing spots were open would make them more likely to study on
            campus and would decrease the amount of time spent looking for a spot.</li>
        <li>People didn't know about study spots outside of traditional areas.</li>
        <li>Finding outlets and school computers was an issue, but not the main issue. </li>
        <li>Other amenities were just as important to people as outlets and computers.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These insights caused us to widen the scope of our project to finding non-traditional study spots on campus that
        meet people's specific needs. We all agreed this was necessary and welcomed more challenging problem.</p>
