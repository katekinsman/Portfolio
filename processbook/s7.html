    <h2>The Fall!</h2>
    <p>At this point in our design process, things had been moving fairly smoothly. Our team felt pretty good about
        our progress and we had been working well together. Our last user test, however, revealed something we hadn't
        expected; something that was a huge blow to our team morale.
    </p>
    <p>The University of Washington, come to find out, had released an app a little over a month before called "Space
        Scout" that was essentially the same as ours, but with a slightly varied interface. As they had been
        developing it for much longer than we had, it seemed to be better than our design in every way. We then
        faced a big decision: with this new information, how would we proceed in our design? We essentially had
        three options:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Proceed as if this app didn't exist,</li>
        <li>Change our design or problem completely, and start from square one, or</li>
        <li>Analyze Space Scout and create a design that improved upon theirs.</li>
    </ul>
