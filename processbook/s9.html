    <h2>Heuristic Evaluation</h2>
    <p>After this last set of prototypes, each of us individually performed a heuristic evaluation of our prototypes,
        based on these 10 heuristics:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Visibility of system status</li>
        <li>Match between system and the real world</li>
        <li>User control and freedom</li>
        <li>Consistency and standards</li>
        <li>Error prevention</li>
        <li>Recognition rather than recall</li>
        <li>Flexibility and efficiency of use</li>
        <li>Aesthetic and minimalist design</li>
        <li>Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors</li>
        <li>Help and documentation</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This evaluation really helped us think through all aspects of our app, catching small,
        but important details, such as the omission of a back button on some pages or lack of feedback on whether
        or not a preference had been selected.</p>
    <h3>Typographic Evaluation</h3>
    <p>We also collectively performed a typographic evaluation of our app, finding 25 things that we could improve
        upon. This helped us think through a lot of the graphical design decisions that we hadn't really taken the
        time to think about before, but resulted in a cluttered interface.</p>
