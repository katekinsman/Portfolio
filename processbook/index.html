                        <h2>Meet the Design</h2>
                        <p>The University of Washington has over 27,000 undergraduate students and when class
                            is in session it is like a small city of its own. When these students need to study, they
                            often turn to campus to find a suitable space with the amenities they need to get their work
                            done, but finding these spots is often a challenge due to the large student population. In a
                            survey conducted by our group, we found that 74% of students said that study spot they end
                            with doesnâ€™t have all the things they need to be productive. Whether it is a lack of plugs
                            or lack of a projector students stated that finding a room with everything they needed was
                            harder than it should be. This is the problem we are trying to solve: we feel that the large
                            campus we have is heavily underutilized.  We set out to solve this problem by making a
                            mobile app that students can use to find a suitable study spot.

                            What follows is the climb we took to get to our final solution.
